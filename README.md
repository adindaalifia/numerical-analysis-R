# the application of numerical analysis method
in statistics, many algebraic process like these:
- solving systems of linear equations
- eigen problem solution
- finding the roots of non-linear equations
- polynomial approximation
- interpolation
- differential and integral
- etc.
##### all of the above algebraic processes can be used to solve problems such as:
1. use a calculator to find root, log, exponential, etc.
2. when use GPS
3. weather prediction
4. etc.
